1. The first thing I did wrong was to create my own form
2. I deleted the form I created 
3. I copied the original form from the Github repo again
4. The next I did was to add pet names to the values in the select options
5. After adding pet names I changed the name attribute in the select tag to pets
6. I committed changes 
7. I pushed to the remote 
8. Next I attempted to deploy to Github pages but got and error message
9. I tried to deploy to Vercel and the wrong page was displayed.
